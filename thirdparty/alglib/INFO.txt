The used source (2007) is under BSD license citation:
"The most important in the version 2.1.0 is a change of license. The decision to change 
the license was not easy. The project was distributed under BSD for about two years. 
But over time it became clear that GPL is more suitable for further project development. 
So starting from version 2.1.0, ALGLIB is distributed under GPL 2+ (GPL version 2 or later). 
License change, of course, affects only 2.1.0 and following versions. Users of 
previous versions may continue to use ALGLIB and distribute derivative code under 
less strict, BSD-compatible terms.
