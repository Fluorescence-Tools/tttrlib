Potential bugs
=============

High priority
-------------
### High effort
1. Check that all the variable types are still okay. To get the library compiled on Windows and MacOS I (TP) had to
change a lot of the variable type (unsigned long, unsigned long long, uint64_t, etc.).
2. Check that all the SWIG wrappers still work (associated with Bug 1.). 
### Low effort


Medium priority

### High effort
1. HDF5 problems when using hdf5>=1.8.16 with conda: It is still unclear where this bug comes from but it seems to
be related to https://github.com/conda-forge/hdf5-feedstock/issues/58
