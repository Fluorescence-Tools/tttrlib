Interoperability and framework enhancements
-------------------------------------------

These tools adapt tttrlib for use with other technologies or otherwise
enhance the functionality of tttrlib estimators.

**Fluorescence decays**

- `fit2x <https://github.com/fluorescence-tools/fit2x>`_
  Fast and efficient library for Python and C/C++ to compute fluorescence decays.

**Fluorescence correlation**

- `katcor <https://github.com/khemmen/katcorr>`_ a collection of scripts and
  correlators that are inspired by the paper Ries...Schwille 2010 Optics
  Express "Automated suppression of sample-related artifacts in FCS".

**Fluorescence lifetime imaging**

- `clsmview <https://gitlab.peulen.xyz/tpeulen/clsmview/>`_ A python program with
  graphical user interface to vizualize and process confocal laser scanning data
  with tttrlib.

**Model definition/optimization/sampling**

- `chisurf <https://github.com/fluorescence-tools/chisurf>`_
  A software package with graphical user interface (GUI) to define, minimize, and
  sample models of fluorescence decays, fluorescence correlation curves, among other
  fluorescence data. ChiSurf is a software package that furthermore integrates
  functionality for structural sampling with FRET restraints, among other tools.


Other tools and libraries
-------------------------

`FRET community <https://www.fret.community/>`_  provides a
`software <https://www.fret.community/software/>`_ list that can be used to process
TTTR data.
