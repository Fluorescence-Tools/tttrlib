  __markedentry = {[thomas:6]},
  abstract      = {In recent years, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has been increasingly applied for the study of polymer dynamics on the nanometer scale. The core idea is to extract, from a measured autocorrelation curve, an effective mean-square displacement function that contains information about the underlying conformational dynamics. The paper presents a fundamental study of the applicability of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for the investigation of nanoscale conformational and diffusional dynamics. We find that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy cannot reliably elucidate processes on length scales much smaller than the resolution limit of the optics used and that its improper use can yield spurious results for the observed dynamics.},

  __markedentry = {[thomas:6]},
  abstract      = {Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is widely used to detect and quantify diffusion processes at the molecular level. The molecules of which diffusion is studied are marked with fluorescent dyes. It is commonly maintained that this technique only applies to systems where the concentration of fluorescent molecules is low. Even if this is the optimal operational condition, we show that FCS can be used also at high concentrations (up to 50$\mu$M) of fluorescent molecules: the detector blinding due to highly fluorescent solutions of concentrated dyes can be avoided by using neutral optic density (OD) filters, and the initial condition of very bad signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be hampered by suitable statistical averaging, as usual in other contexts of signal analysis.},
