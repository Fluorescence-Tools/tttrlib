  abstract = {Photon arrival-time interval distribution ({PAID}) analysis is a new method for monitoring macromolecular interactions. {PAID} uses fluorescence fluctuations to extract simultaneously coincidence, brightness in multiple channels, diffusion time, and concentration of fluorescently labeled molecules diffusing in a confocal detection volume. {PAID} is based on recording arrival times of photons detected on one or more detection channels and plotting two-dimensional histograms of photon pairs, where one axis is the time interval between each pair of photons 1 and 2 (in general not consecutive or detected in the same channel) and the second axis is the number of other photons detected (not necessarily detected in the same channels as photons 1 and 2) in the time interval between detection of photons 1 and 2. {PAID} is related to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ({FCS}) by a collapse of the {PAID} histogram onto the time interval axis. {PAID} extends auto- and cross-correlation {FCS} by measuring the brightness of fluorescent species. Studies of fluorescently labeled {DNA} demonstrate the capabilities of {PAID} to analyze interactions:  {PAID} detected that {DNA} carrying two copies of the fluorophore Cy3B is twice as bright as {DNA} carrying only one copy (simulating dimer vs monomer). {PAID} also distinguished well between {DNA} carrying only one fluorophore (Cy3 or Cy5) and {DNA} carrying both Cy3 and Cy5 (simulating complex vs free components). Solutions containing mixtures of these {DNA} fragments were successfully analyzed. Studies of Escherichia coli {RNA}-polymerase−{DNA} interactions demonstrate the ability of {PAID} to analyze the complex mixtures expected in studies of macromolecular interactions. The statistical accuracy of {PAID} matches the accuracy of other fluorescence fluctuation methods while providing additional information.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has been increasingly applied for the study of polymer dynamics on the nanometer scale. The core idea is to extract, from a measured autocorrelation curve, an effective mean-square displacement function that contains information about the underlying conformational dynamics. The paper presents a fundamental study of the applicability of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for the investigation of nanoscale conformational and diffusional dynamics. We find that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy cannot reliably elucidate processes on length scales much smaller than the resolution limit of the optics used and that its improper use can yield spurious results for the observed dynamics.},

  __markedentry = {[thomas:6]},
  abstract      = {Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is widely used to detect and quantify diffusion processes at the molecular level. The molecules of which diffusion is studied are marked with fluorescent dyes. It is commonly maintained that this technique only applies to systems where the concentration of fluorescent molecules is low. Even if this is the optimal operational condition, we show that FCS can be used also at high concentrations (up to 50$\mu$M) of fluorescent molecules: the detector blinding due to highly fluorescent solutions of concentrated dyes can be avoided by using neutral optic density (OD) filters, and the initial condition of very bad signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be hampered by suitable statistical averaging, as usual in other contexts of signal analysis.},
