Process time-tagged time resolved (TTTR) data with a unified application programming interface (API) that entitles you
to process data of TTTR experiments without the need of data conversion with your preferred scripting language.

tttrlib is a low level, high performance API to read and process time-tagged-time resolved (TTTR) data acquired by
PicoQuant (PQ), Becker&Hickl measurement devices/cards, and TTTR files of the open Photon-HDF format. Feature include:

   - Multi-dimensional histograms
   - Correlation analysis
   - Time-window analysis
   - Photon distribution analysis
   - FLIM image generation and analysis
