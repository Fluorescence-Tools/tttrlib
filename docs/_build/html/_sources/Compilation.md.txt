tttrlib can be compiled with the [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) Community
edition. In addition to Visual Studio a [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) library with include files need to be 
installed. The tttrlib distribution provides files for the use with [cmake](https://cmake.org/). In addition to 
A recent 64bit [Python](https://www.python.org/) installation is required. All precompiled Windows libraries 
were compiled on Windows 10 with a minimal 64bit Python 2.7 [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
installation.
