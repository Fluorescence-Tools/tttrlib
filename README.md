## General description


tttrlib is a file format agnostic low level, high performance API to 
read and process time-tagged-time resolved (TTTR) data acquired by 
PicoQuant (PQ) and Becker&Hickl measurement devices/cards or TTTR 
files in the open Photon-HDF format.

The library tttrlib facilitates the work with files containing 
time-tagged time resolved photon streams by providing 
a vendor independent C++ application programming interface (API) 
for TTTR files that is wrapped by SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface 
Generator) for common scripting languages as Python as target languages 
and non-scripting languages such as C# and Java including Octave, 
Scilab and R.

*  Multi-dimensional histograms
*  Correlation analysis
*  Time-window analysis
*  Photon distribution anaylsis
*  FLIM image generation and analysis

![LabelLib and other software/libraries][3]

tttrlib is NOT intended as ready-to-use software for specific application 
purposes.


## Supported file formats

### PicoQuant (PQ)
*  PicoHarp ptu, T2/T3
*  HydraHarp ptu, T2/T3
*  HydraHarp ht3, PTU

### Becker & Hickl (BH)
*  spc132 
*  spc630 (256 & 4096 mode)

## Design goals

*  Low memory footprint (keep objective large datasets, e.g.  FLIM in memory). 
   Particulary useful for FLIM.
*  Platform independent C/C++ library with interfaces for scripting libraries 

## Capabilities

*  Fast (IO limited) Reading TTTR files
*  Generation / analysis of fluorescence decays
*  Time window analysis
*  Correlation of time event traces
*  Filtering of time event traces to generate instrument response functions for fluorescence decays 
   analysis without the need of independent measurements.. 
*  Fast photon distribution analysis
*  Fast selection of photons from a photon stream

Generation of fluorescence decay histograms tttrlib outperforms pure numpy and Python based
libraries by a factor of ~40  


## Implementation

Pure pure C/C++ and CUDA based high performance algorithms for real-time and interactive 
analysis of TTTR data.

# Building and Installation

## C++ shared library

The C++ shared library can be installed from source with [cmake](https://cmake.org/):

```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tpeulen/tttrlib.git
mkdir tttrlib/build; cd tttrlib/build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

On Linux you can build and install a package instead (prefered):

## Python bindings
The Python bindings can be either be installed by downloading and compiling the source code or by using a 
precompiled distribution for Python anaconda environment.


The following commands can be used to download and compile the source code:

```console
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tpeulen/tttrlib.git
cd tttrlib
sudo python setup.py install
```

In an [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment the library can 
be installed by the following command: 
```console
conda install -c tpeulen tttrlib
```

For most users the later approach is recommended. Currently, pre-compiled 
packages for the anaconda distribution system are available for:

*  Windows: Python 2.7, Python 3.7 (x64)
*  Linux: Python 2.7, Python 3.7 (x64)
*  MacOs: Python 2.7 (x64)

Legacy 32-bit platforms are currently not supported.

# Documentation

The API of tttrlib as well as some use cases are documented on its [web page](https://tpeulen.github.io/tttrlib) 

Note, tttrlib is highly experimental library in current development. In 
case you notice unusual behaviour do not hesitate to contact the authors.
