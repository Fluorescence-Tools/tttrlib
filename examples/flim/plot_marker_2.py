CLSM marker in imaging (Leica)
==============================

It is not always fully documented how a manufacturer of a microscope encodes
laser scanning microscopy data in TTTR files. Often it is unclear
how the frame and line marker are integrated into the event data stream. Below,
an analysis of the frame and line marker is briefly outlined for a Leica SP8
dataset.

First, the data corresponding to the image needs to be saved as TTTR-file. Leica
uses PicoQuant PTU files that can be loaded in ``tttrlib``.

from __future__ import print_function

data = tttrlib.TTTR('../../tttr-data/imaging/leica/sp8/da/G-28_C-28_S1_6_1.ptu')

e = data.event_types
c = data.routing_channels
t = data.macro_times
m = data.micro_times

"""
The routing channels are inspected to determine the actual channel
numbers of the detectors. A bincount over the channel numbers determines 
how often a channel occurs in the data stream.
"""

# Look for used channels
y = np.bincount(c)
print(y)
plt.plot(y)
plt.show()

"""
In the dataset two channels were populated (channel 1 and channel 15). 
For the measurements only a single detector was used. Hence, likely, 
channel 15 was used to encode other information.

    * 1 - 3009504
    * 15 - 95325

.. note::

    Usually, the TTTR records utilize the event type to distinguish markers from
    photons. Leica decided to use the routing channel number to identify
    markers.


Based on these counts, channel 15 very likely identifies the markers. The number
of events 95325 closely matches a multiple of 2 (95325 = 93 * 512 + 3). Note,
there are 1024 lines in the images, 4 images in the file.

By looking at the macro time one can also finds that there are 93 images in
the file, as intensity within the image in non-uniform. Hence, the macro time
fluctuates.
"""

"""
To make sure that the routing channel 1 is indeed a detection channels,
one can create (in a time-resolved experiment) a bincount of the associated micro
times.
"""
m_ch_1 = m[np.where(c == 1)]
y = np.bincount(m_ch_1)
plt.plot(y)
plt.show()


"""
Next, to identify if in addition to the channel number 15 the markers are identified
by non-photon event marker we make a bincount of the channel numbers, where the
event type is 1 (photon events have the event type 0, non-photon events have the
event type 1).

"""
To sum up, channel 1 is a routing channels of the detector. Channel 15 is 
the routing channel used to inject the special markers. Next, we inspect
the micro time and the macro time of the events registered by the routing channel
15.

The plot of the micro times for the events of the routing channel 15 reveals, that
the micro time is either 1, 2, or 4. A more close inspection reveals that a micro
time value of 1 is always succeeded by a micro time value of 2.

"""

m_ch_15 = m[np.where(c == 15)]

"""
A micro time value of 4 is followed by a micro time value of 1. This means, that 
the micro time encodes the frame marker and the line start/stop
markers.

    * micro time 1 - line start
    * micro time 2 - line stop
    * micro time 4 - frame start

.. note::
    The first frame does not have a frame start.

Next, the macro time of the events where the routing channel number equals 15 is
inspected. As anticipated, the macro time increases on first glance continuously.
On closer inspection, however, steps in the macro time are visible.

plt.plot(t[np.where(c == 15)])
plt.show()

"""

To sum up, in the Leica SP8 PTU files

    1. line and frame markers are treated as regular photons.
    2. the line and frame markers are identified by the routing channel number 15
    3. the type of a marker is encoded in the micro time of channels with a channel number 15

.. note::

    Usually, the TTTR records utilize the event type to distinguish markers from
    photons. Here, Leica decided to use the routing channel number to identify markers.
    When opening an image in ``tttrlib`` this special case is considered by specifying
    the reading routine.
