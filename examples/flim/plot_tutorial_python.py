Tutorial: Image construction
============================

Below, using a few lines of python code it is outlined how CLSM images can be
constructured. For productive uses ``tttrlib`` provides a set of functions to
create images based on CLSM TTTR data implemented in C/C++. To describe how this
is actually implemented, it is outlined below in Python only using basic the basic
functionality of ``tttrlib``. The presented outline presented below may serve to
understand how the image construction in CLSM work and is not intended for
productive use.

Before creating an image the channel numbers of the frame and the line markers need
to be determined. For the example that is shown above the frame, line start, and
line stop markers are 4, 1, and 2, respectively. Next, the TTTR data needs to be
loaded into memory, the number of frames, and the number of lines need to be determined
in order to allocate memory for the image. In CLSM the number of pixels per line
can be arbitrarily defined, as the laser beam is continuously displaced and the
fluorescence of the sample is continuously recorded. Hence, the main experimental
determinants of the image size in memory are the number of frames and the number
of line scans per frame. Usually, the number of line scans per frame is constant
within a TTTR file.

The number of frames can be determined by counting extracting and counting the number
of frame markers as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    import tttrlib
    import numpy as np
    import pylab as p

    def count_marker(channels, event_types, marker, event_type):
        n = 0
        for i, ci in enumerate(channels):
            if (ci == marker) and (event_types[i] == event_type):
                n += 1
        return n

    def find_marker(channels, event_types, maker, event_type=1):
        r = list()
        for i, ci in enumerate(channels):
            if (ci == maker) and (event_types[i] == event_type):
                r.append(i)
        return np.array(r)

    events = tttrlib.TTTR('./examples/PQ/HT3/PQ_HT3_CLSM.ht3', 1)
    e = events.get_event_type()
    c = events.get_routing_channel()
    t = events.get_macro_time()
    m = events.get_micro_time()

    frame_marker_list = find_marker(c, e, 4)
    line_start_marker_list = find_marker(c, e, 1)
    line_stop_marker_list = initialize(c, e, 2)
    n_frames = len(frame_marker_list) - 1 # 41
    n_line_start_marker = len(line_start_marker_list) # 10246
    n_lines_per_frame = n_line_start_marker / n_frames # 256
    line_duration_valid = t[line_stop_marker_list] - t[line_start_marker_list]
    line_duration_total = t[line_start_marker_list[1:]] - t[line_start_marker_list[0:-1]]
    n_pixel = 256
    pixel_duration = line_duration_valid // n_pixel
    line_duration_valid = t[line_stop_marker_list] - t[line_start_marker_list]

.. note::
    The channel number of the frame makers (here 4) depends on the experimental
    setup. Moreover, some setup configurations use "photons" event types to record
    special events. Different microscopes may use different markers. For common
    microscopes such as the Leica SP5 and Leica SP8 ready-to-use image processing
    routines are provided.

In the example above, first the number of frames are counted. Next, the number of
start line events are counted. In the example, there are overall 41 frames are present
in the file each having 256 lines. As the last frame is often incomplete (see Figure
above) the last frame is neglected (41 - 1 = 40). With the script above, the number
of frames ``n_frames`` and the number of lines per frame ``n_lines_per_frame`` is
determined. Next, the number of pixel per line ``n_pixel`` can be freely defined.
Based on the time the laser spends in each line, the duration per pixel (the laser
is constantly scanning) needs to be calculated. Here, there are two options: 1)
either the total time from the beginning of each new line (line start) to the beginning
of the next line is considered as a line or 2) the time between the line start and
the line stop is considered as the time base to calculate the pixel duration. In
the first case, the back movement of the laser to the line start can be visualized
in the image. In the later case, only the *valid* region where the laser scans over
the sample is visualized. For most applications the later approach is useful. To
understand the microscope laser scanner the former approach is more useful. Above,
``line_duration_valid`` is the time the laser spends in every of the lines in a
valid region and ``line_duration_total`` is the total time the laser spends in a
line including the rewind to the line beginning. Above, ``n_pixel`` is the freely
defined number of pixels per line and ``pixel_duration`` is the duration of every
pixel. With the number of frames ``n_frames``, the number of pixels ``n_pixel``,
and the number of lines ``n_lines_per_frame`` it is clear how much the memory for
an image needs to be can be allocated and with the defined number of pixels per
line the duration for the pixel can be calculated for all the lines of the frames.

With these numbers an image for a certain set of detector channels ``detector_channels``
can be calculated. Below this is by the function ``make_image``.

            c, m, t, e,

            channels,
            frame_marker=4,

        if n_pixel is None:
            n_pixel = n_lines_per_frame  # assume squared image

        n_tac = n_tac_max / tac_coarsening
        image = np.zeros((n_frames, n_lines_per_frame, n_pixel, n_tac))
        # iterate through all photons in a line and add to image

        frame = -1
        current_line = 0
        time_start_line = 0
        invalid_range = True
        mask_invalid = True
        for ci, mi, ti, ei in zip(c, m, t, e):
            if ei == 1:  # marker
                if ci == frame_marker:
                    frame += 1
                    current_line = 0
                    if frame < n_frames:
                        continue
                    else:
                        break
                elif ci == start:
                    time_start_line = ti
                    invalid_range = False
                    continue
                elif ci == stop:
                    invalid_range = True
                    current_line += 1
                    continue
            elif ei == 0:  # photon
                if ci in channels and (not invalid_range or not mask_invalid):
                    pixel = int((ti - time_start_line) // pixel_duration[current_line])
                    if pixel < n_pixel:
                        tac = mi / tac_coarsening
                        image[frame, current_line, pixel, tac] += 1
        return image

    image = make_image(c, m, t, e, n_frames, n_lines_per_frame, pixel_duration,
        channels=np.array([0, 1])
    )

In the example function ``make_image`` the an 3D array is created that contains in
every pixel a histogram of the micro times. An histogram of the micro time can be
displayed by the code shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    fig, ax = p.subplots(1, 2)
    ax[0].imshow(image.sum(axis=(0, 3)), cmap='inferno')
    ax[1].plot(image.sum(axis=0)[175,128])
    p.show()

The outcome of such analysis for a complete working example is shown below including
all necessary source code is `here <https://github.com/Fluorescence-Tools/tttrlib/tree/master/docs/plots/imaging_python.py>`_.

For any practical applications it is recommended the determine the images using
the built-in functions of ``tttrlib``. Using this functions is illustrated below.
