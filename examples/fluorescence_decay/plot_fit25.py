==================
Lifetime selection
==================

fit25
-----
Selects the lifetime out of a set of 4 fixed lifetimes that best describes the data.
Works with polarization resolved Jordi stacks, computes rotational correlation time
by the anisotropy. This function selects out of a set of 4 lifetimes tau the lifetime
that fits best the data.

fit26
-----
Pattern fit. Determines the fraction :math:`f` of two mixed patterns.

.. :math:

    g_i = f \cdot pattern_{1,i} + (1-f) \cdot pattern_{2,i}

(No convolution of patterns, area of pattern is normalized by fit)
