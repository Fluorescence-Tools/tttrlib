===================================
Count rate filtered correlation - 2
===================================
Scan count rate filter and compute stack of correlation
functions for different mean count rates in time windows.
Potential application: filter aggregates, see also
PAID correlation (Laurence???)


Low count rate regions of a TTTR file can be discriminated. The example below
displays the correlation analysis of a single molecule FRET experiment. Note,
the background has a significant contribution to the unfiltered correlation
function. The example uses a sliding time-window (TW). TWs with less than a
certain amount of photons are discriminated by the selection.


Such a filter can be used to remove the background in a single-molecule experiment
that decreased the correlation amplitude.
