Release Highlights for tttrlib 0.20
========================================

.. currentmodule:: tttrlib

We are pleased to announce the release of tttrlib 0.20, which comes
with many bug fixes and new features! We detail below a few of the major
features of this release. For an exhaustive list of all the changes, please
refer to the :ref:`release notes <changes_0_20>`.

To install the latest version with conda::

    conda install -c tpeulen scikit-learn

# %%
# Test for plotting
# ------------------------------------
#
# The :func:`inspection.permutation_importance` can be used to get an
# estimate of the importance of each feature, for any fitted estimator:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.linspace(0, 5)
ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))
ax.set_title("Permutation Importance of each feature")
ax.set_ylabel("Features")
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %%
# Improved PTU header support
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# The :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`
# and :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` now have native
# support for missing values (NaNs). This means that there is no need for
# imputing data when training or predicting.

print("Better Header support")

# %%
# Writing of TTTR data
# ------------------------------------------
# Most estimators based on nearest neighbors graphs now accept precomputed
# sparse graphs as input, to reuse the same graph for multiple estimator fits.
# To use this feature in a pipeline, one can use the `memory` parameter, along
# with one of the two new transformers,
# :class:`neighbors.KNeighborsTransformer` and
# :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsTransformer`. The precomputation
# can also be performed by custom estimators to use alternative
# implementations, such as approximate nearest neighbors methods.
# See more details in the :ref:`User Guide <neighbors_transformer>`.

from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
import tttrlib


# with TemporaryDirectory(prefix="tttrlib_temp_") as tmpdir:
#     estimator = make_pipeline(
#         KNeighborsTransformer(n_neighbors=10, mode='distance'),
#         Isomap(n_neighbors=10, metric='precomputed'),
#         memory=tmpdir)
#     estimator.fit(X)
#
#     # We can decrease the number of neighbors and the graph will not be
#     # recomputed.
#     estimator.set_params(isomap__n_neighbors=5)
#     estimator.fit(X)
